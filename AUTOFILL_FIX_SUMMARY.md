# RequestDocuments Autofill Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Database Field Mapping**
- **Problem**: Frontend was expecting `mobile_number` but database uses `contact_number`
- **Solution**: Added helper function `getPhoneNumber()` that prioritizes `contact_number` from database
- **Problem**: Frontend was using `current_address` but database has `full_address` as primary field
- **Solution**: Updated `getAddress()` helper to prioritize `full_address` from database

### 2. **Missing Form Fields**
- **Problem**: Document forms were missing important fields like contact number and business address
- **Solution**: Added missing fields to all document form definitions:
  - `contact_number` field added to all document types
  - `businessAddress` field added to Business Permit
  - All fields marked as `autoFill: true` where appropriate

### 3. **Removed Duplicate Components**
- **Problem**: Individual document components (BrgyClearance.jsx, BrgyBusinessPermit.jsx, etc.) were not using autofill
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed these components from routing
  - Removed imports from App.jsx
  - Updated index.jsx exports
  - All document requests now use the main RequestDocuments.jsx component with autofill

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive logging to track data flow:
  - API response data
  - Data normalization process
  - State setting operations
  - Field mapping verification

## Database Fields Mapped

| Frontend Field | Database Field | Document Types |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| `contact_number` | `contact_number` | All |
| `full_address` | `full_address` | Indigency |
| `address` | `full_address` | Clearance, Residency |
| `businessAddress` | `full_address` | Business Permit |
| `name`/`fullName` | `first_name` + `middle_name` + `last_name` | All |
| `current_photo`/`avatar` | `current_photo` or `avatar` | Clearance (photo) |

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/residents/RequestDocuments.jsx` - Main fixes
2. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Removed individual component imports
3. `frontend/src/config/routes.js` - Removed individual component routes
4. `frontend/src/pages/residents/index.jsx` - Removed individual component exports

## Testing Required
- Test autofill functionality for each document type
- Verify that database fields are correctly mapped
- Ensure all required fields are auto-populated
- Check that manual fields (purpose, amount) still require user input
